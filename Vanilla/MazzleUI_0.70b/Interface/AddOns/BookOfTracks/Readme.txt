*** PURPOSE ***

My main character is a hunter. To access easily all those tracking skills, it 
is necessary to reserve a complete action bar.

I got tired of this action bar and decided to program my own addon to access 
those skills through a simple drop down menu

I know, different addons propose the same feature, but I wanted the simplest 
thing without any option. Since I have a fair addon programming experience now
(cf. BookOfCrafts) it was easier for me to program it than to wait for someone
to answer my needs.



*** INSTALLATION & USAGE ***

Install the Add-on in your Interface/Add-on directory.

If your character knows at least one tracking skill (resources tracking, hunter
skill or demonist senses), you may click on the minimap tracking icon to access
all those skills

Left Click  : Display list
Right Click : Cancel current track or displau list if no tracking active



*** OPTIONS ***

No option at all. This is a simple add-on



*** COMPATIBILITIES ***

No issue known at this time



*** FUTURE FEATURES THAT MAY COME, ONE DAY ***

Nothing at this time



*** KNOWN PROBLEMS ***

Tell me



*** DEPENDENCIES ***

Nothing



*** NOTES ***

This add-on has been thoroughly tested in French only. It is provided with
Deutsch and English localization which I cannot test, so the quality of BoT
behavior in those 2 languages depends on users feedback.

Also, if someone wants to provide Korean translation, he/she's
welcome :)
