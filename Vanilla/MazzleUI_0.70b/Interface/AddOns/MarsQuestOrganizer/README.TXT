FEATURE OVERVIEW:
===========================================================================

Adds a new slash command ("/q") that allows you to change the sections in
which your quests appear.  To use this AddOn, just type "/q" in the game.
For example, if you have a Scarlet Monastery quest that is showing up under
"Thousand Needles" because that is where you picked it up and you want to
remember to do it when you are in Scarlet Monastery, select the quest and
type "/q Scarlet Monastery".  The quest will be moved there.  You can also
group quests under non-zone headings.  For example, if you want to save a
quest to do Saturday, you might type "/q Do Saturday".  The quest will be
moved to a new heading called "Do Saturday".
