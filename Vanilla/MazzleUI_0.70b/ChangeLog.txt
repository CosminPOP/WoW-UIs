MazzleUI Change Log:

0.7
- Feature Addition: MazzleOptions and MazzleHelp integrated into one add-on with a button to switch between the two modes.  I think it will be easier for users to see everything in one interface.  MazzleOptions code was also much better and more flexible.
- Feature Addition: MazzleOptions now has an integrated FAQ system.  It automatically numbers sections/questions and presents questions and answers appropriately.
- Feature Addition: TONS of new help and FAQ questions added to MazzleOptions help system.  All documents re-organized and rewritten.
- Feature Addition: Mazzifier will now prompt the user to re-enable add-ons it needs to change the settings for.  Clicking yes will automatically enable all such add-ons and reload the UI.
- Layout Change: Moved improved error frame button near other minimap buttons so certain button layouts have more room.
- Feature Addition: MazzleUI will automatically adjust minimap buttons for add-ons that are disabled and aren't showing their buttons.
- Bug Fix: You no longer will have problems clicking on links at the bottom of the general chat window.  Hid the resize edges of the chat frame.  (Thanks to Tigerheart for figuring it out)
- Bug Fix: Fixed MonkeyQuest showing up in the middle left rather than top left in some aspect ratios
- Bug Fix: Dots on you will show up in right combat log
- Bug Fix: XRaidStatus should properly mazzify in all cases now
- Feature Addition: Added auto dismounting at flight masters since it was lost when changing from FlightPath to ToFu.
- Bug Fix: Divine Spirit fixed in NeedyList (credit to Tiger for the fix)
- Add-On Set Change: Added SimpleCombatLog, Fubar Mail and BookofTracks to "Minimal" set.
- Settings Change: Turned buff timers on in Blizzard settings module.  (Don't know how/why it got to be off)
- Settings Change: Fixed bindings of autobar buttons.  (new ace2 version changed things)
- Feature Addition: Button layout browser will now only show layouts that are universal or applicable to your class.
- Bug Fix: Clicking the "Button Layout" checkbox in Mazzifier will not throw an illegal ID error
- Feature Addition: Mazzifier now configures AtlasLoot settings
- Settings Change: Necrosis now at 130%, purple skin, buffs on left and timers off.
- Add-On Change: Replaced vChat and Teknicolor with Prat.
- Button Layout Change:  All button layout descriptions updates and all new preview pictures in the Mazzifier.
- Feature Addition: Mazzifier can now consider a list of spells when deciding what to put in a button! It will put the first item found from the list into the button.  It will also not put an item that it has already placed before.  Creating layouts that can handle multiple talent specs, character levels, racial abilities, etc. is much easier to do now.
- Feature Addition: Added mount set to replace previous single mount binding in all layouts.  Considers all current mounts in the game.  You no longer have to learn how to use DAB to do drop your mount into slot 120.
- Feature Addition: Added set of ALL tradeskills to three buttons in the context menu.  This should guarantee that everybody's trade skills show up right, including supporting skills like Disenchanting and Smelting.
- Feature Addition: Added a racial skills set button to every layout.  All racial skills should show up now.  (Note: You may still need to add cannibalize to some of the layouts that didn't have room.)
- Button Layout Change: All max spells changed to be several levels higher.  This means all layouts should properly place AQ and BC level spells.
- Button Layout Change: DAB cooldown counts all turned off since OmniCC does them and a bit more
- Button Layout Change: Changed context menu scripts in the button layouts to use options in MazzleOptions, so that it won't hide on click if you don't want it to.
- Button Layout Change: Changed pet and shapeshift forms to have visible locations for all classes.  (for future use and special cases like Razorgore possession)
- Feature Addition: New button layout, "Big Buttons Simple".  It's like the Simple layout, but with fewer buttons that are much larger.  Good for low resolution and/or 1.25 aspect ratio.
- Add-On Selection Change: Enemy Cast Bar defaults to off.  (It's just too expensive)
- Mage Layout:
    - Fixed overlapping bars when certain skills are missing
    - Cleaned up positioning of bars
    - Combined combustion and arcane power into the same button (when mazzifying, not in general)
    - Added multiple oil set for the oil button
    - Added multiple polymorph set to the polymorph button
    - Added blastwave to AOE bar
    - Adjusted pet and shapeshift bar locations
    - Added 1.33 version
- Priest Layout:
    - Fixed overlapping bars when certain skills are missing
    - Cleaned up positioning of bars
    - Added auto-applying oil button
    - Now handles shadow spec spells
    - Now handles Power Infusion, Lightwell and Divine Spirit
    - Now handles all racial priest spells, not just Fear Ward.  Desperate prayer, Hex of Weakness, Starshards and Devouring Plague grouped in one button, while Feedback, Fear Ward, Shadowguard, Elune's Grace and Touch of Weakness is in another.
    - Should be better for leveling.  Will place lesser heal and heal buttons in certain spots when you don't have greater heal or heal.  Will do the same for cure poison when you don't have abolish poison.
    - Adjusted pet and shapeshift bar locations
    - Added 1.33 version
    - Fixed shoot wand binding
- Hunter Layout:
    - Changed range check to use wing clip.  Ranged bar will now show in all cases except when wing clip is in range.  (before melee would show when completely out of range of both melee and ranged weapons)
    - Added missing Aspect of the Beast and ordered aspects based on levels you acquire them
    - Feign death button moved so that it doesn't overlap pvp icon.  F5 binding added by request.

    - Added Wyvern Sting, Counter-Attack and Trueshot Aura
- Warlock Layout:
    - Improved bindings
    - Fixed overlapping bars when certain skills are missing

    - Detect Greater Invisibility and Detect Lesser Invisibility merged into one button
    - Demon Skin and Demon Armour merged into one button
    - Added warlock mounts to mount sets so they'll install just like normal mounts and be bound to shift-~
    - Reordered curses
    - Reordered fears
    - Shoot wand should properly work on F1
Shaman
    - Added combination Elemental Mastery/Stormstrike button
    - Added Nature's Swiftness
    - Added Mana Tide Totem
    - Re-organized layout
    - Improved bindings
Shaman Durzil
    - Added stormstrike, nature's swiftness and mana tide totems (spots for the latter two probably don't make sense, but I didn't want to mess with the layout)
    - Cleaned up various layout problems (some anchors, overlapping battleground icon and gatherer, proper pet and shapeshift bar location)
    - Note: Does not fit in 1.25 aspect ratio
Rogue Simple
    - Added racial buttons
    - Improved bindings

    - Added some action placements
    - Rearranged bars to be consistent with other layouts (main bar is top right)
    - Improved key bindings
    
0.6
- Feature Addition: Improved hot-swappable layouts.  Much cleaner and more organized.
    (1) - There are now 15 different views.  They are the permutations of raid frames on bottom, raid frames on top, mt window on side, mt window on top, mt window on top with ToToT, showing party frames and hiding party frames.  MazzleUI will dynamically adjust locations, raid frame sizes, MT window sizes, and showing MT ToToT depending on the parameters of that view and your aspect ratio.
    (2) - Each of those views has a 20 man-version where applicable.  MazzleUI will automatically redistribute your raid frames when your raid has less than 20 members.  It will redistribute back when you add more players to the raid.
    (3) - MazzleUI will now automatically move up your main tank windows upwards depending on whether you are showing party pets.  (only applicable to 1.33 and 1.25 aspect ratios, and only when you have the MT windows set to show on the side.)
    (4) - Key bindings for views now let you independently modify raid position (top/bottom/none), MT position (side, top, top wide), and Party Showing (yes/no).  It's easier to get the view you want now.
------------------------
- Feature Addition: Much improved Mazzifier Add-On Selection Options
    (1) - Can now choose between different core add-on sets: (1) Full Install (HIGHLY recommended), (2) Less features, faster loading time, (3) Less features, less cpu usage, (4) bare minimum features.
    (2) - Now has a section for "Special-Purpose Add-ons", where you can select to enable/disable (1) raiding add-ons, (2) pvp addons, (3) auction house addons, and (4) raid leading add-ons.
    (3) - Now has a section for "Expensive Optional Add-ons", where you can enable add-ons that will be disabled in most default setups, namely (1) Gatherer, (2) Damage meters (you can choose from Recap, SWStats, and DamageMeters), and (3) Natur's Enemy Castbars, and (4) KLH Threat Meter.
------------------------
- Feature Addition: Much improved MazzleOptions navigation 
    (1) - Now has an alphabetized, dynamically-generated directory of all add-ons in the package.  Clicking on an entry will take you to the appropriate category that contains the addon, its description and its options.  (Click on the topic Add-On Directory, at the top of the list to see this)
    (2) - Mousing over any category will list all the add-ons in that category
    (3) - The categorization themselves have been simplified.  It should be easier to find the options you are looking for now.
------------------------
- Feature Addition: Mazzifier now differentiates between settings that are global and those that contain character-specific information!  Will now only mazzify global settings once per Mazzifier version.  This mean you will no longer overwrite global settings you may have changed when you mazzify a new character.  Mazzifier will now also consider Blizzard settings just like an add-on with global settings.  It has been moved from the parts list to the add-on list.
- Feature Addition: Add-ons that are selected for Mazzification but are not currently loaded will be grayed out in the Mazzifier.  This is because their settings cannot be changed without first enabling them.  I think this will clear up some of those mysterious bug reports where add-ons aren't being mazzified for some people.
- Feature Addition: Mazzifier now configures button bindings seperately from blizzard settings
- Feature Addition: Mazzifier will now clear previous action placement when configuring buttons.  This means you won't get strange actions in slots where the Mazzifier could not find the appropriate spell.  It also means that the simple layouts will start blank when "place actions" is checked.
- Feature Addition: Mazzifier now has a close button.
- Feature Addition: In MazzleOptions, when enabling or disabling an add-on, it will warn the user that they must reload for the changes to take effect and provide a button that allows them to do so.
- Feature Addition: New MazzleUI option allows you to set whether the context menu will move to your mouse location when opened.
- Feature Addition: New MazzleUI option allows you to set whether the context menu will automatically hide when an item is used within it.
- Feature Addition: Many new entries and GUI options added to MazzleOptions.  Old obsolete entries removed.  
- Feature Addition: Added new hotspot that toggles context menu.  Located in old decursive hotspot location, middle right.
- Feature Addition: Added tell target ability to replace one removed with Chat Frame Extender, by default alt-t.
- Feature Addition: SimpleCompass hotspot changed to toggle AlphaMap instead.
- Feature Addition: MazzleUI will now show WarmUp frame after logging in when WarmUp is enabled for a one-time execution.
------------------------
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Added more layout profiles to sRaid to handle the new raid views system.  Changed spacing of title names so that they look better in current layouts.  Made them closer to the groups.
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Changed oRA2 main tank frames to be slimmed down when placed on the side layouts.
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Changed vChat to not hide the scroll to bottom button so we can still see it flash when not at bottom.  Added dfm settings that moved and resized the icons to make them a little less intrusive.
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: A bunch of significant changes to EasyCopy, an add-on that lets you copy any text from your chat frames
        - Fixed handling of "|C" control code.
        - Removed OnUpdate processing (completely unnecessary) and just hooked the right functions in OnLoad.  Removed hooking of chatframes 6 and 7.  I don't think we need copying in the combat logs.         - Removed printing of time stamps (vChat's is better) and just use an @ at the beginning of the line for copying text.  
        - Changed font color to match UI.  
        - Changed borders of EasyCopy's editbox to match UI.  
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Change StatusWindows to be saved per character for those people who play on multiple servers in different time zones.
------------------------
- Layout Change: 3d model platforms now silver blue to match rest of unit frame color scheme
- Layout Change: Removed DUF's combo points and added positional data for ColorComboPoints
- Layout Change: Moved AVBars to left side of screen so they are less likely to be accidentally clicked.  Also scaled a little larger.
- Layout Change: Moved Character frame, SuperInspect and DressUp window so that they can all be seen without overlapping each other.
- Layout Change: Answering Machine scaled to 300%.  (so you can see when you are far away from your computer)
------------------------
- Settings Change: Updated Fubar add-on ordering and display settings for many fubar plugins
- Settings Change: Activate hoverlink in EQCompare
- Settings Change: Clique settings added for Mage, Priest, Druid, Shaman and Paladin added to Mazzifier.  (If there are ones that make sense for other classes, please post.  Please also comment on settings chosen, especially for Druid, Shaman and Paladin.)
------------------------
- Button Layout Change: Added Durzil's Shaman layout.
------------------------
- Bug Fix: Context menu will no longer appear when dragging items or skills.
- Bug Fix: Hud numbers will no longer occasionally show when HUD is completely disabled

- Bug Fix: Screenshot function should now be correctly bound to print screen button
- Bug Fix: Context menu will properly remember shown or hidden state.
- Bug Fix: Bag and micromenu bars will work properly upon login when initially shown (before you had to click the MazzleUI text twice to hide)
- Bug Fix: Target model will now bring up target menu when right-clicked anywhere in the frame.
- Bug Fix: Changed Autobar slider range checking to stop moving of autobar position when options are opened
- Bug Fix: You can once again right-click on Natur's Enemy Castbar icon to quickly disable or enable the addon
- Bug Fix: SpellAlertSCT will once again properly unregister events when disabled in efficiency modes
- Bug Fix: Mazzifier will not throw an error when KCItems or ChatManager is not enabled when run.
------------------------
- Add-On Change: Removed CT RaidAssist and all related automatic layout code for it.  sRaid and oRA is completely compatible and far leaner and faster.  Even though the CTRA option worked fine, I removed it now b/c I would have eventually done it when BC comes out.
- Add-On Change: Added ColorComboPoints to rogue and druid sets
- Add-On Change: Added DamageMeters, SWStats, Gatherer, KLH ThreatMeter.  (all of these are expensive and will be disabled by default).  Some settings added to mazzifier for these add-ons
- Add-On Change: Replaced ChatFrameExtender and CleanChat with vChat and Teknicolor.  (lower cost Ace2 alternatives.  Features aren't quite there yet, but it's close and will improve.)  Added Mazzifier settings for vChat.
- Add-On Change: Replaced CT_MailMod with gMail. (lower cost Ace2 alternative.  Note: Author says mass mail may still be a little flaky)
- Add-On Change: Replaced AceHeal with Clique.  More features, nicer interface and BC ready.  Healing logic of ace heal no longer needed.
- Add-On Change: Replaced SpellAlert SCT with WitchHunt (Tried it before, but it wasn't mature enough.  Seems to be a lot better now.) Also changed efficiency mode to toggle witch hunt instead of SpellAlert.
- Add-On Change: Replaced oRA with oRA2.  (I can finally fit the MT windows into the layouts.)
- Add-On Change: Replaced FlightPath with FuBar ToFu.  (lighter, didn't find many features of flightpath all that necessary)
- Add-On Change: Removed AutoShoutOut.  Popular demand.
- Add-On Change: Removed Duel Inspect. Popular demand.
- Add-On Change: Replaced EquipCompare with EQC.  Lighter-weight version of the same thing.
- Add-On Change: Removed SimpleCompass.  Popular demand.

0.5
- Feature Addition: Final Mazz3D add-on
    - Completed model survey.  Every single model currently in game should display properly positioned and sized.
    - Much smaller footprint and more efficient.  
        - Clever guessing code, hashing model and complex database manipulation code no longer needed and now removed. :(  All debug and camera survey code removed.
        - All data collection fields of the database pruned
        - Add-On is now completely restructured and much of it has been rewritten (code is Ace'd and far less generalized)
        - Event handling streamlined (events handling is now modular, ability to enable and disable portions)
        - Now adjusts cameras when models change shape more accurately.  Bosses that morph, druid shapeshifting, and mage polymorth all handled seamlessly now.
        - OnUpdate processing scaled back dramatically.  Most of the time it will not even be on.  Only turned on for short bursts when doing animation or adjusting the model.
- Feature Addition: sRaidFrames setup now has 6 different raid layouts: (1) 8 groups on bottom, (2) party frames and no raid, (3)8 raid groups on top and party on bottom, (4) 8 raid groups on top only, (5) 8 raid groups on top centered around MT windows on top, party on bottom, and (6)8 raid groups on top centered around MT windows on top, no party
- Feature Addition: oRA main tank window will now automatically move in 1.25 aspect ratio when using sRaid frames with 8 groups on bottm
- Feature Addition: New option to turn off all MazzleUI raid frame management, for those of you who want to move your raid frames around manually.

Button name will now also change to say enable, disable, don't enable and don't disable according to current state.
- Feature Addition: Many new MazzleOptions entries added.  Some obsolete entries removed.
- Feature Addition: Mazzifier will not incrementally change bindings so you're less likely to have your bindings changed when updating.  (note: next version will split out bindings from blizzard settings)

- Feature Addition: MazzleOptions now has a button to restore detached chat windows, in case that bug hits you.  (it's under the Mazzifier category)
- Code Improvement: All embedded Ace2 libraries consolidated in one central library directory.  All embedded libraries removed.  Should make initial loading faster and initial pre-garbage collection memory use smaller.

- Bug Fix: HUD will now check combat status when zoning
- Bug Fix: MazzleOptions will now properly set values for add-ons that may have empty data structures (like AHFilters Plus)

- Add-on Change: Removed Lootster (and stomped up and down on it until it was a bloody pulp).  It was causing the raid lockup problem.
- Add-on Change: Went back to the old CharactersViewer.  New one has a really unnecessary dependency on a character profiling add-on and seems to be moving in a more bloated direction.
- Add-On Change: Added Tigerheart's AutoAcceptInvite.  (settings GUI will be added in next version.  command to access right now is /aai)
- Add-On Updates: 
                    AH_QuickSearch_v1.4

0.40

- Feature Addition: Added 4 automatic MazzleUI efficiency modes!  These modes optionally kick in when you are either (1) in combat, (2) in a party, (3) in a raid or (4) are pvp flagged.  You can now set exactly what gets turned off in any of the efficiency modes, including the manual one, via the new options GUI.  This can be used to not only to scale back settings, but to activate addons only in contexts where they are useful.
- Feature Addition: Complete load-on-demand options system called MazzleOption now fully implemented
    - Every add-on has an entry with full description and one-click enabling and disabling!
    - Every add-on has a GUI to change options even if the base add-on only has slash commands!
    - Many add-ons have value-added options that extend the add-ons functionality, for example, auto-hiding the resurrection monitor when you are not on a healer or are not dead yourself.
    - MazzleUI itself now has a multitude of options
        - HUD now has an always show option.  You can now change the transparency level of the HUD seperately for in-combat, out-of-combat states.  Can also change transparency level of Target of Target and combo points.
        - Mazz3D add-on allows you to selectively turn off animations, random animations, event-based animations and model adjustments.  You can also change debug settings related to the camera survey now.
        - Mazzifier can be launched and be told to force current version database to be up to date
        - Mazzle efficiency modes has a full interface to set exactly what is active in each mode.  (more on that below)
        - All hidden hotspots can now be toggled off
        - Automation ptions to auto-hide context menu, auto-accept resurrections, auto-accepts summons
        - Special raid settings such as automatically switching raid layouts depending on whether it's a 20-man or 40-man
- Feature Addition: Now has an option to use a package of oRA, sRaid and BigWigs instead of CT Raid Assist!  They are faster, use less memory and are compatible with raids using CT Raid Assist.  Raid frames in the oRA option are handled by a version of sRaid that is modified to position raid groups out in the same way that my CT layout did.
- Feature Addition: New Target of Target hotspot.  Click anywhere undearneath the target cave (where it says "Look at person x.")
- Feature Addition: Added 3d animation enabling/disabling in efficiency modes.  Toggles events and onUpdate processing.
- Feature Addition: Added name tags enabling disabling in efficiency modes.  Can swap all nametag settings, including new friendly name plates, depending on what mode you're in.  Currently set to only enable name tags when pvp flagged.
- Feature Addition: Added ability to toggle Natur's Enemy Cast Bars in efficiency modes.  
- Feature Addition: Added ability to toggle compass in efficiency modes.  
- Feature Addition: Added ability to toggle FastCast latency compensation in efficiency modes.  (remember lag does not equal latency, so you will most likely only need to use this in manual mode if at all.)
- Feature Addition: Added ability to toggle BigWigs boss warnings in efficiency modes.  
- Feature Addition: Added ability to toggle Scrolling Combat Text in efficiency modes.
- Feature Addition: Added ability to toggle Scrolling Combat Text Damage in efficiency modes.
- Feature Addition: Added ability to toggle Scrolling Combat Text Cooldowns in efficiency modes.
- Feature Addition: Added ability to toggle SpellAlert SCT in efficiency modes.
- Feature Addition: Added ability to toggle visibility of all DAB buttons/floaters and control boxes in efficiency modes.
- Feature Addition: Added ability to change to a lower Discord update rate during efficiency modes.
- Feature Addition: Improved Mazzifier with more install options
    - Add-On mazzification now split into Add-On Selection and Add-On Settings.  The former determines which add-ons get disabled, while the latter determines which ones have settings modified.  There is a new tab frame for add-on selection now.
    - Add-On Selection pane allows you to select one of four raid packages: (1) CT RaidAssist, (2) CT RaidAssist + BossMods, (3) sRaid, oRA and oRA raiding modules, and (4) sRaid, oRA, oRA raiding modules and oRA raid leading modules
    - Add-On Selection pane allows you to select other raiding add-ons such as BigWigs
    - Button layout selector now has a checkbutton to allow you to suppress automatic placement of your spells into the buttons, so now you can modify your button layouts by themselves.
    - The tab frames are now traversed with a series of "Next" buttons to encourage people to double-check/customize settings.  Mazzify button only shows up after you hit next on the last tab frame.
- Feature Addition: MazzleUI will now automatically switch to your favorite 20 man or 40 man raid layout depending on the size of the raid.
- Feature Addition: Added new hotzone to open xCalc (bottom right corner)
- Feature Addition: Changed Needylist hotspot to toggle Decursive windows instead.  You can right-click same hot spot if you still want to toggle visibility of NeedyList.
- Feature Addition: Added new hotzone to select target of target (area under target box)
- Feature Addition: AceHeal now also a mage-enabled addon.  Right-Click = AI, Shift-RClick = AB, Ctrl-RClick = Dampen, Alt-RClick = Amplify, Alt-LClick = Remove Curse

- Feature Addition: Added settings for TinyTip to Mazzifier
- Feature Addition: Added settings for SpellAlertSCT to Mazzifier
- Feature Addition: Added settings for ChatCast to Mazzifier

- Feature Addition: Added settings and positional data for BigWigs
- Feature Addition: Added settings for CEnemyCastBar to Mazzifier (need feedback and suggestions on these settings!).  Also moved from PvP set to general set.
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Added the ability to right-click on CEnemyCastBar's minimap icon to quickly disable or enable it.
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Added onupdate throttling to Scrolling Combat Text Cooldowns (full rate updates were not necessary.)  Also added enable and disable commands to fully unregister events when add-on is disabled by MazzleUI efficiency mode.
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Added aceheal interface to sRaid
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Throttled SCT Cooldowns OnUpdating
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Turned off SpellAlert SCT OnUpdating if feign death setting is off
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: MerchantBags will now also open bags when opening trade
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Changed MovableBags so that it places bags initially in a good spot for the MazzleUI layout
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Added enable and disable commands to SpellAlert SCT to fully unregister events when add-on is disabled by MazzleUI efficiency mode.  Also changed code to disable all onupdate processing when feign death retargeting was not enabled.  (It was previously doing an unthrottled onUpdate that did nothing but check a variable when it was disabled)
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Made changes to Answering Machine, AutoRank, ChatManager, FastCast and SimpleCombatLog to allow options to be set via MazzleOptions.
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Stopped RaidFrameKiller from indicating when it kills frames.
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: Added two new layouts to sRaidFrames auto layout function.
- Layout Change: Itemref tooltips moved higher so they are less likely to overlap unit tooltips
- Layout change: HUD target health now shows actual amount instead of percentage
- Layout change: Various unit frame text now more clear as per Tigerheart suggestions (increased alpha, added shadows).  Also changed some colors in 1.6 aspect.
- Layout change: Added more actual health and mana amounts to party unit frames, and target unit frame for all three aspect ratios.  Moved other elements to accomodate.
- Layout Change: Whether an enemy is tapped is now more clearly labelled
- Code Improvement: MazzleUI add-on now "Ace'd".  (At least somewhat, doesn't really doesn't change much performance-wise, but does make some event handling cleaner.)
- Bug Fix: Fixed positioning of main decursive window.  Add-on changed the frame name.
- 3rd Party Add-On Modification: C'thun warner fixed for 1.12 changes.  Few bugs also fixed as well as picture compressed.  All done by Tigerheart.
- Bug Fix: Model damage overlays will no longer get truncated when the message is too long (for e.g. with resists)
- Bug Fix: Stopped LoadIT from placing a button in the main menu.  Was not playing well with other buttons.
- Bug Fix: Disabled frame repositioning in CT Raid (experimental)

- Bug Fix: HUD numbers now synchronized with the appearance of the graphics (no longer relies on DUF to show in combat)
- Bug Fix: Energy value in HUD now correct for rogues.
- Bug Fix: Fixed all DART layouts so that HUD would stop stealing mousewheel input

- Bug Fix: KCItems will no longer give error about performing math on nil when starting up with no KCItems database
- Bug Fix: Applied fixes from Ace forums so that KC_Mobility does not mess up escape closing on some windows
- Settings Change: The "simple" setups are now the default for most classes.  I'm finding the people who prefer to use a simple Blizzard-like layout are also the ones who don't have the savvy to switch the button layout before Mazzifying. :D
- Settings Change: Updated CleanChat settings for format change.
- Settings Change: Updated ChatFrameExtender settings for format change.
- Settings Change: Added MobHealth3 settings and starting database.
- Settings Change: Added oRA settings.
- Settings Change: Added sRaid settings.
- Settings Change: Added initial xRaid settings.
- Settings Change: Updated all settings for Fubar 2.0

- Settings Change: Added various new key bindings
- Settings Change: Mendeleev now has more categories active
- Settings Change: MonkeyQuest now anchored to topleft of screen and grows down
- Settings Change: Updated TrinketMenu settings to incorporate new settings in new version.  Also turned off cooldown numbers since OmniCC handles.

- Settings Change: Updated Fubar module position.
- Settings Change: Updated CT RaidAssist Settings
- Settings Change: Updated DFM settings for change in name of Autobar frames
- Settings Change: Changed SimpleCombatLog to shows dots on others, so that you can now see see ignite and similar things tick in offensive combat window.  Should also show leeching type stuff
- Add-On Change: Added modified version of sRaidFrames.  It's a light-weight alternative to ct's raid frames.  Added new layout code to properly place raid frames making room for the target box and, in the case of the smaller 1.25 resolution, moving groups 7 and 8 to an alternate locations.
- Add-On Change: Added BigWigs, syncable, personal raid warning system.
- Add-On Change: Added oRA and a variety of modules.
- Add-On Change: Removed RestFu.  It was causing Mendeleev to give an error sometimes when mousing over things.  Will re-add when one of the two are fixed.
- Add-On Change: Replaced Notebook with Gello's TinyPad.  Better features and it even matches the UI. :)
- Add-On Change: Replaced MobileFrames with KC_Mobility and MovableBags (lighter weight and does not conflict with TinyTip)
- Add-On Change: Replaced TipBuddy with TinyTips (lighter weight and seems to resolve some blizzard tooltip issues
- Add-On Change: Replaced Metamap with Alphamap.  (Metamap was just starting to incorporate way too many other add-ons that I have no interest in.)
- Add-On Change: Replaced Recap with Recap-ParserLib (should be more efficient now since it uses the same parsing engine that Simple Combat Log does)
- Add-On Change: Removed PeriodicTable (I don't think anything in MazzleUI uses it anymore that doesn't already have it embedded)
- Add-On Change: Removed FizzWidget AdSpace (didn't seem useful enough)
- Add-On Change: Added BigWigs (personal boss warning timer that is syncable, blocks raid leader spam and shows some great timers)
- Add-On Change: Added MonkeyQuestLog.  Replacement of the QuestLog that works hand in hand with MonkeyQuest.
- Add-On Change: Added PartySpotter to the pvp set.  (Colors icons for people on the map depending on whether they're in your group, raid, etc.)
- Add-On Change: Added ChatCast. Now that someone has fixed the bugs, it's back!  (Look for links in your chat that will do cool things when clicked.)
- Add-On Change: Removed AceNameToggle (no longer needed.  Fubar has a plugin, and new MazzleUI options will have an auto-pvp toggle)
- Add-On Change: Removed ChatFrameFix (no longer needed)
- Add-On Change: Removed MailSound.  (was never being used, since you guys didn't have the data files!  What kind of testers are you?!? :D)
- Add-On Change: Removed SortEnchant.  Advanced Trade Skill Window now handles enchanting as well.
- Add-On Change: Removed Catalyst. No longer needed post-1.11.  Added to conflict list, so the Mazzifier will now disable it.

0.28
- Feature Addition: Added 9 new layouts:  Simple Rogue, Simple Druid, and Simple Warrior for each of the three resolutions.  These are layouts for our beloved nublets who want something similar to the Blizzard default setup.  Each layout has 4 or 5 bars, one of which pages based on stance/steal/form.  Rogue layout also includes a poison bar for one-click poison application.
- Feature Addition: Switches to chat frame 1 upon login to compensate for Blizzard's switching to the last frame.
- Bug Fix: Updating the base key binding set will no longer overwrite settings defined in your DAB layout. It will now save your DAB bindings, re-install base key bindings, and then reapply your DAB ones over it!
- Bug Fix: AceHeal, KC Items, and MyBindings are now all per character.  Some were per class before and were sometimes getting reset to the default profile when another ones profile was switched.  P.S. I hate Ace's profile mechanism.
- Bug Fix: Metamap settings changed so you can right and left click to zoom in and out by default.  
- Bug Fix: Priest layouts Resurrection button now aligned vertically with only one bar to avoid overlap with priests missing certain talents.
- Bug Fix: Reverted back to old version of AceHeal to preserve backward compatibility until I get new settings configured.
- Add-On Change: Replaced HitsMode with SimpleCombatLog.  (still being updated and lighterweight.  Also uses ParserLib which may allow for even more efficiency down the line.)
- Add-On Change: Replaced OpenBags with Cirk's MerchantBags (kinda arbitrary, but seems lower cost and more recently updated.  And I like Cirk's other addons.)
- Add-On Change: Removed RecapFu.  (Decided it's not worth the update cost since the bar is by default hidden)
- Code Improvement: Updated to new timex function format
