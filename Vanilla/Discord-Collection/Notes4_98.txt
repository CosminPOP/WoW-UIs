v4.98
* Updated the .toc version number.
* Fixed tooltip scanning for buff names, etc. broken by patch 1.10.
* Possibly fixed the long-standing problem of bars not being initialized properly until you open and close the options window.
* Fixed GB's data tooltip being displayed.
* Fixed the cooldown display being slightly too small. Try unchecking the option in misc options to modify it by UI scale if the size is still off.
* Fixed the rank scaling for Divine Spirit.
* Added Prayer of Spirit to the buffs list. Needs localization for non-English clients.
* Holy Nova will now be excluded from being chosen by Prevent Overhealing.
* Divine Spirit and Prayer of Spirit will now correctly detect if the unit is buffed by either.
* Shadow Protection and Prayer of Shadow Protection will now correctly detect if the unit is buffed by either.
* 10th rank of Renew is now counted for rank scaling.
* Adjusted handling of the data tooltip in order to fix a number of things.
* Stopped raid bars from updating if they're hidden and raid members change. Should help with raid lag issues for those who don't use the raid bars. May cause issues, let me know.
* Exorcism will now consider Demons to be valid targets.
* Added a Healing Bonus editbox to Misc Options. Type in your total +healing and press enter to have the bonus applied to all GB's data for your healing spells. It uses the (casting time/3.5) * bonus formula to determine how much to add to each spell.
* Lower Rank When Mana's Low will no longer change your spellcast while Spirit of Redemption is active. Needs translations for German clients.
* Fixed Prevent Overhealing choosing Resurrection occassionally.   Needs localization if other languages have that problem.
* Fixed a GB_Initialization.lua error for clients that use a , instead of . for decimal points.
* Holy Wrath will now consider Demons to be valid targets.
* Fixed Exorcism not considering undead to be valid targets.
* The target bars will no longer try to return you to your last target fixing issues with random friendly NPCs of the same name getting targeted.
* Removed the code for cancelling a spell that failed to cast, getting it off your cursor. It no longer seems to be necessary. You can now use targeted AE spells from GB's bars.
* Raid members will now be checked by default when they're added to the raid. Players you've unchecked in order to hide thier bars will remain unchecked when the raid changes. No need to constantly dive into the options window anymore.
* French localization update courtesy of Sturmy.
* German localization update courtesy of Meldas.
* Prevent Overhealing will now choose the lowest mana cost spell that will heal your target to full. So your overhealing percent may be a little higher now but you'll be spending less mana.
* Added support for Perl Classic Unit Frames.
* Heavily optimized tooltip parsing for checking buffs/debuffs.
* Any other random crap I coded in the period between beta g and beta h but didn't make a note of.
* Added an option to Misc Options to automatically cancel Shadowform or an animal form when casting a heal and only heals. (You can tell I respecced shadow to do some pvping can't you?)
* Added the Greater Blessings to the area effect buffs list.
* Fixed GB getting stuck considering you in combat if you zone while in combat.
* Added options in Misc Options to limit the Area Heal Threshold and Lowest Health Bar to only check units within follow distance (around 28 yards).
* Added support for character-specific macros.
* The new ranks of Blessing of Wisdom and Might should now be used by buff scaling.
