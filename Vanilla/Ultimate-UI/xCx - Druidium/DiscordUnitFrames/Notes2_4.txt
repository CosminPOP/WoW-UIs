v2.4
*  JUST A NOTE *  There are two common issues with DUF: status bars can display behind the background for the status bar and the stack count on debuffs can hide behind a debuff's icon texture.  Both these issues are fixed by setting the element's Frame Strata option to LOW or higher.  The BACKGROUND strata seems to place everything on the same draw layer which causes the two issues mentioned.

New Features:
* Added options to Health/Mana Bars and TextBoxes to show only when in combat, health is less than max, and/or mana is less than max.
* Added an option to show text in a TextBox vertically.  Remember that you'll have to increase the height of the TextBox to keep the text from getting cut off.
* Added a new variable, $cz.  It will display all text following it in the color of the unit's power type.  It gets the color from the Mana Bar element on the same frame.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed TextBox scales getting thrown off when you scale up a unit frame.
* Fixed the character's profile not being set when you create a new profile.
