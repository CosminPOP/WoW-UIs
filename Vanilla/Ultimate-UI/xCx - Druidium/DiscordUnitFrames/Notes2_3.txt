v2.3

** BIG WARNING **
This update will erase your character settings.  HOWEVER, your saved settings are safe.  They will be converted to profiles.  Before installing this update, be sure to go to each character who's personal settings you want to keep and save them.  Also, back-up your DiscordUnitFrames.lua file in the WTF\SavedVariables folder if you want to be able to return to a previous version.

You will have to set a profile in Misc Options for each character upon first logging in with this update installed.

New Features:
* The options window is now a separate, load on demand add-on.
* Vastly reduced load time (and not just because of the above feature).
* Changed from per character settings with extra saved settings to shared profiles.  Multiple characters can use the same profile and they'll all access the same set of settings.  Changes made on any one of those characters will apply to all characters that use the same profile.  You no longer need to Save or Quick Save your settings and create a copy of them, all changes are immediately applied to the profile.
* Added Safe Load and Copy buttons.  These will load/copy settings then reload the UI instead of applying them immediately.  It's a way to get around settings that cause WoW to exit with no error message.  Just couldn't stop that from happening.
* There is now a full readme included in the download.

Bug Fixes:
* Hopefully fixed some issues with the party and target pop-up menus.
* Fixed an issue copying to and from the Self frame.
* Fixed the Buff/Debuff duration format checkbox showing up for frames besides the Self frame.
* Hopefully fixed an issue with buffs blinking that don't have a duration.
* Fixed an issue with the applications count on the Self frame's debuffs.
* Hide On Mouseover will now use the mouseover groups.
