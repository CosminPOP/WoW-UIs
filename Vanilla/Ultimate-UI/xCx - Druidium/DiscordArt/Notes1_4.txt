v1.4
* Updated the .toc file.
* Added tabs to the Texture Browser: Default UI, Macro Icons, and Custom. Default UI holds a bunch of textures pulled from the WoW's default UI. Macro Icons will show all macro icons. Custom holds all textures you've added.
* Finally added a lot more textures from the default UI.
* Fixed the labels for the Coord boxes in the Texture Browser.
* Fixed some issues with the DART_StatusBar function.
* Coords will now default to 0, 1, 0, 1.
* The DART_Options_SetProfile(profileName) function will no longer require the options window to have been loaded.
