v1.2
New Features:
* The options window is now a separate, load on demand add-on.
* Changed the texture selection menu in the upper-right to a scrolling frame.  It can now handle any number of textures so you're no longer capped at 70.
* Added an option to stop the texture from intercepting input from the mousewheel.
* If a non-existent frame is specified for one of the Anchor Frames, it will change that setting to UIParent.  Should help with errors from some custom layouts.  Same goes for the Parent Frame option.
* Moved the definition of textures to the DART_Textures.xml file.  This file will never be changed by me so you can define your additional textures there.
* Removed the macro icons from the texture browser.  Just didn't think they were necessary.
* Script buttons which hold an active script will be marked with a *.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed an error thrown if you had changed any font settings.
