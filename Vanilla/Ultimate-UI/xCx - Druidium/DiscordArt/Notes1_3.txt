v1.3:
* Added additional options to support the new 8-parameter SetTexCoord function.  Setting only the first 4 coords will still work though.  The DART_Texture function now looks like this: DART_Texture(ti, file, {ULx or x1, ULx or x2, LLx or y1, LLy or y2, URx, URy, LRx, LRy}).  All 4 of the new, optional coords must be defined in order to use the 8-parameter version.  Here's a diagram to show each corner's coordinates and the settings you need to display the full, undistorted texture:

(ULx=0, ULy=0)    (URx=1, URy=0)
             ------------------------
	    |                      |
	    |                      |
	     ------------------------
(LLx=0, LLy=1)     (LRx=1, LRy=1)

Hopefully someone understands that.  :D
I've decided to have the Texture Browser not support 8 coords for now.
* Added a DART_StatusBar(ti, percent, dimension, [direction], [baseX1, baseX2, baseY1, baseY2]) function.  It will cause the texture passed to it to be resized and cropped based on the percent passed to it, just like a status bar.  The dimension parameter is the height or width (depending on the direction you specify) of the status bar when it's full.  Valid directions are: nil - fills left to right, 1 - fills right to left, 2 - fills top to bottom, 3 - fills bottom to top.  The optional base parameters are used to limit the coordinates the status bar stretches between.  The functions assumes you're using the full texture if you don't specify anything for those parameters.  You can use anything to set the percent.  For example, a 150 pixels wide status bar for a unit's mana would look like this: DART_StatusBar(ti, 150, UnitMana("unit ID")/UnitManaMax("unit ID"));
* Fixed the textures for the scrollbar in the Scripts editbox.
* Fixed an issue where settings texture's font then changing it back to nothing would cause an error.
