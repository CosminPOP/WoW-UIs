There are so many features I added to UUI, that often many of them go unnoticed. But no longer - here in this very text file you will learn about EVERY feature UUI has to offer. :)
I try to keep this updated as often as I can, but I update UUI very often and changing all the files in this folder with the new 'updated' addon list and information et al is a hassle. All the info you need to know about an addon can be read in the Addons section at the character selection screen.
