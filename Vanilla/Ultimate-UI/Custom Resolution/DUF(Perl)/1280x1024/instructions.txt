The file in this folder should go to the following location:

DUF_Custom.lua  ->  C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons\DiscordUnitFrames\

You should be prompted to overwrite / replace files - you should click Yes.

Btw, WoW shouldn't be running when you do this, though I suppose it wouldn't entirely matter if you /console reloadui. Anyways, load WoW and:

Type /duf -> Misc Options -> Select 'Custom' from the dropdown and hit 'Load'

- If you aren't using the correct resolution for these files, then the art will look 'off'.
- if you sure you are using the correct resolution and files then simply relog and when you come back everything should be all set.

Remember:
YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR OWN PROFILE IN 'MISC OPTIONS' IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING FROM THE CUSTOM SETTINGS. Any changes to the Custom Settings will NOT be saved.

Enjoy!
