Simply pick the folder that matches the resolution you want to use in game. You should only be looking in this folder if you want to use the widescreen resolution or for backups of the other resolution files.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE FILES IN THIS FOLDER IF YOU PLAN TO PLAY WOW AT 1280x1024 OR 1024x768 RESOLUTION! THOSE FILES ARE ALREADY IN THEIR APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS.
