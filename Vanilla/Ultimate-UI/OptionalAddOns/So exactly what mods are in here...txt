Many useful optional addon mods here!

> Rogues should DEFINATELY use both the rogue addons in the Rogue folder.
> Druidbar is a MUST for druids.
> Hunters should consider using AspectMenu and smartpet - both are very useful. The other mods in the hunter folder are great but nothing compared to those first two.

> In the MISC folder, several handy mods are available.

 - AutoInvite: invite people who whisper you a certain word (yes, this can be done with CTraid as well) OR automatically invite people from a predefined list of players. Very handy indeed yes.
 - CallToArms: A great mod, if only more people used it! The only reason it's not in the main folder is because of the fact that it hogs the /who command so you often have trouble shift clicking names because the mod used /who too recently. I find that far too annoying, but it might not matter to you so feel free to try it out.
 -  Decursive (not an updated one because you can use a decursive feature in CTRaidAssist now anyways. But the old ones still here if anyone wants to use it (assuming it's not blocked by the UI in this new patch 1.10).
 - Lootlink: A classic. Takes a lot of time to load but some people can't live without this.
 - WeaponQuickSwap: one of the easiest to use weapon swaping mods in the game. I love it.
 - And then some... feel free to check them all out!
