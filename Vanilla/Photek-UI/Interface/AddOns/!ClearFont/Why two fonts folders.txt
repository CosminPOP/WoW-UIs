Why two font folders?
---------------------
(the following info does not apply to 'ClearFontNumber.ttf' - confusing, yes, I know)


'Fonts' contains v1.0 of the ClearFont font, Calibri.

- The numbers are fixed width and fixed height.
- Currently used automatically.


'Fonts2' contains v0.9 of the ClearFont font, Calibri.

- The numbers are neither fixed width nor fixed height.
- If you wish to use this version use the fonts contained within 'Fonts2':

  - Change the following line in the ClearFont.lua and ClearFontAddons.lua files from:
	local CLEAR_FONT_BASE = "Interface\\AddOns\\!ClearFont\\Fonts\\";
    to:
	local CLEAR_FONT_BASE = "Interface\\AddOns\\!ClearFont\\Fonts2\\";
