# WoW UIs
A simple collection of Vanilla, Tbc and Wotlk UIs

## Note:
I do not own any of the UIs. 
All credits go to the respective creators.
I do not provide any support.
Some UIs may not work at all. 
Some UIs are getting updated as the respective creator is pushing updates to his respective UI repository.

I am only interested in legacy UIs and will not add any UIs past Wotlk.
 
## How to add your UI to the list
Create an issue and provide a repository link or a download link to your UI pack.
Links to repositories will garantee that each update on your UI will also be reflected here.
