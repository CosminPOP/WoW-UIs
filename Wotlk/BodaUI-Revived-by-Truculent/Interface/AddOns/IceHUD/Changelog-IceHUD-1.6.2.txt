Added mechanism to provide common throttled updates to all bars, even those that are hidden.
Added "Display when ready" option to Custom Cooldown bar to replace "Display when empty" toggle.
Modified Custom Cooldown bar to use common throttled updates. This should be rolled out to all bars eventually.
Tidied up display of spell icons in Custom Cooldown bar. There was a problem with the appropriate aura icon not being loaded correctly until the spell had fired.
