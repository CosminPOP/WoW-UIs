    Unzip CaithUI.rar to a new folder called CaithUI. 
    
    Open there the wtf-folder and change the three folders:

          ACCOUNTNAME (has to be in caps)
          Servername 
          Playername

    to your specific ones.

    For example: WTF\Account\CAITHACCOUNT\Gorgonnash\Caithlyn






                              >> 2 <<


    Go into your normal World of Warcraft directory. 
    
    Backup there your interface and wtf folder. 
    
    Then delete only your interface folder.





                              
                              >> 3 <<
    
    
    Copy & overwrite the folders wtf, interface and fonts from 
    
    \CaithUI\ to your world of warcraft directory.



    In your warcraft directory, Go to your overwritten WTF-folder, 
    
    open the config.wtf with WordPad, NotePad2 or something like that. 
    
    
    Search for:

          SET uiScale
          SET useUiScale


    change those values to:

          SET uiScale "0.78"
          SET useUiScale "1"


    if they weren't there, just add them. Save the config.wtf.





                              >> 5 <<


    Start WoW. 
    
    Make sure every addon is enabled. 
    
    Type into your chat: /reflux switch CaithUI
    
    The interface should reload automaticly.
    
    
    
    Maybe the chat won't be in the black boxes. Just drag it into them.
    
    
    Should work now.
