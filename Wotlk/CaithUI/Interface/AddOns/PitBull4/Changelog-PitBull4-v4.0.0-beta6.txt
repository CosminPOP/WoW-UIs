Tagging v4.0.0-beta6


--------------------

Shefki:
	- Replace the VisualHeal module that used LibHealComm-3.0 with the 4.0 one
	that was experimental.
	- Bump TOC for 3.3.0
	- Workaround for the You are not in a party stuff.
	- Oops called the wrong update function which broke the ability to disable
	VisualHeal4 per layout.
	- Ticket 606: Groups that were enabled and then redisabled during a single
	session would not get their state map updated and would show again on
	the next state change.  Most of the complaints were about party pets,
	but it was universal to any group.
	- Fix spell id for Chains of Ice for PTR, but backward compatabile with
	3.2.x as well.
	- Oops forgot to updated the load.xml for VisualHeal4 with the correct
	libraries.
	- Fix some .pkgmeta syntax errors
	- Add a module with experimental LibHealComm-4.0 support.
	- Ticket 297: Anchor text so it doesn't hang over the edge when set to
	position on the edges of the unit frame.  This makes the text anchor
	slightly different than indicators placed in the same place since they
	will be centered on the corner.
	- Not sure what the heck I was thinking when I did this.
	Revert "Allow Party frames to be shown when in a raid per the Show when options"
	
	This reverts commit 4ad10da05c73d28d33d170dfc0485506d45228c7.
	- Fix typos in RangeFader that broke long enemy range tests for Shaman and
	Warriors.
	- Allow Party frames to be shown when in a raid per the Show when options
	under filtering.
	- Fix Unholy Blight in Aura filters, was changed in 3.2 and got missed.
	- Properly enable/disable some spells based on player race from filters.
	- Add Blood Corruption for B.Elf Paladins and make Holy Vengeance be
	alliance Paladin specific.
	- Remove the filter for just Vengeance, no idea how we got this but it was
	an NPC ability not a Paladin ability.
	- Typo in the spellid for Seal of Corruption.
	- Aura filters: Seal of Vengeance is alliance only and Seal of Corruption
	(horde version of Seal of Vengeance) was missing entirely.
	- More appropriate hat for the day.
	- Try and load LibHealComm if VisualHeal is enabled, also for dev
	enviornments.
	- Try to load LibBanzai when the Aggro mdoule loads for dev environments.
	- Don't set hooks if the module is disabled.
	- Small performance improvement with the Portrait module.
vangual:
	- Don't query Banzai when it's not loaded.
Shefki:
	- Add Hunger For Blood to Rogue Self Buffs.
	- Fix a case where I missed or UNKNOWN which caused SmartRace() to return
	nil sometimes.
