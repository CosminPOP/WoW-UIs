This addon accelerates key bindings so that they are activated by key press rather than key release. This allows you to activate your abilities faster than you could otherwise. This can really make a difference for situations where you need to react quickly, like when casting heals, when interrupting spells, or in PvP. In these situations, the addon can have an effect similar to reducing your network latency by 100ms. Of course, the exact impact depends entirely upon how much time you personally spend between key press and release.

This addon supports all the main key bindings you are likely to use, including key bindings of actions, key bindings of button clicks, and key bindings of macros. The addon has no effect on your mouse interaction with the game.
