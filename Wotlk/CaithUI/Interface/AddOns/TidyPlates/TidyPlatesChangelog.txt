5.10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
++ "Avoid Overlap" (Alias) in panel
++ "Autoshow" Option in panel
++ Independent Frame
	* scale pass-through	(Not fully implemented; using Virtual Plates AND a theme which changes scale will show oddities)
	* force alpha override	(The developer can tell Tidy Plates to force the alpha - avoiding Blizzard's default alpha - by returning 'true' as a second value for the return)
		- ex. theme.SetAlpha = function(unit) return 1, true end  -- Will maintain the opacity at 100%, regardless of target status
++ Set Default CVars after VARIABLES_LOADED
++ Dual Spec Support (Changes theme based on spec)
	- Added a second dropdown menu in panel
++ Troubleshooting Panel
	- Vkey/Bindings
	- reset/reload
++ Widgets
	+ created TidyPlatesWidgets. table
		+ Threat Wheel 
		+ Class Icon Widget
		+ Combo Point Widget 
		+ Threat Line 
		+ MT Logic Widget  
	+ Syntax usage will follow
++ Scale pass-through	(Not Complete; Using Virtual Plates AND a theme which changes scale will show oddities)
++ Performance Enhancements
++ More Comments (woo?)
++ Code Re-organization 
++ Widgets now use TidyPlatesWidgets:HideIn(), and a watcher frame to perform time checks; Faster than having
	each widget process for OnUpdate
++ Improvements to Panel Helpers
++ 	Unit Info table
	+ .GUID (from mouseover or target)
++ Grey Theme 
	++ Critter/Neutral Filter checkbox
	++ Panel redesign
	++ Tank Mode; "Expands the size of runaway mobs"
	++ DPS Mode; "Expands the size of aggro'd mobs"
	++ Widgets
	++ Each of my own themes should have their own config panel for role,
		allowing dual spec to work seamlessly..
		TidyPlatesThemes["Grey (DPS)"] = config
		TidyPlatesThemes["Grey (Tank)"] =  copytable(config)
++ Virtual Plates should now behave better
	* Scale-changing plates will still cause problemos, but now, ordinary plates will work just fine.
	* Returning NIL in your ScaleDelegate function (if  you've got multiple modes) will allow VirtualPlates passthrough.
++ Grey Tank/DPS panels and saved variables got some love; They work better
	+ Delegate functions now use local variables for speed
+ Fixed Forceupdate	
+ Fixed some Grey variables
+ something else.. forgot what it was.  (Ok, I remembered;  I spelled "deficit" wrong.  I bought the wrong vowel!)
+ Fixed Health Text modes
* Grey Theme 
	- Added Current Health + Percent
* Widgets
	- General Mouseover Widget
	- Combo Point Widget
* Still had trouble with nameplate alpha changes updating after the OnShow call.
	-- Solution: Indvidual Plate echo-update  
* Retracted "Raid-Tanked" Widget (for the time-being)
* Added an extended.widget table
	- Theme designers should put all their widget references in this table
* When nameplates are changed (manually or auto) by the Tidy Plates UI, 
	the software will attempt to hide/clear any frames listed under the
	extended.widget table.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.9.5
* Critter Filter on default theme, returned to Mode-level

5.9.3
* frame layering tweaks
* moved some skinning code around
* casting progress now forces single plate graphical updates (to eliminate casting icon oddities)
* painted my nails

5.9.2
* removed some old code related to the frame separation "feature" *shudder*
* frames faded too much (more than 50%); problem fixed
* level text will not show when skull icon is active

[B][SIZE="3"]Beta Versions[/SIZE][/B]

Beta 1
The biggest changes: Independent alpha control, internal widgets, dual spec support, troubleshooting panel, sweeping performance enhancements.

Beta 2
Significant core changes, hopefully for much better performance (it's faster in my own tests).  Started splitting 'Grey' into two themes; Grey/Tank and Grey/DPS.  Both will have their own panels.  Neither panel is finished (or even partially working).

Beta 3
More core changes, and changes to the panel utility functions (not that anyone besides me uses em) Grey Theme modifications (heavy).  "Grey\Tank" is the first subtheme, which will be followed by "Grey\DPS".  If you want to help me out, make some suggestions about "Grey\PVP" features.  Can't promise anything, but I'll give it a shot.

Beta 4
The new Grey theme is pretty much done.  Both Tank and DPS panels are active, and the functions work.  The new widget, "Main Tanked", has been implemented; It looks at your target and mouseovertargets for characters that are main tanks in your raid.  The nameplates will still expand when another player has aggro (in tank mode), but you'll get a nice icon indicating if it's being tanked, or if it's attacking a squishy.  Bear in mind, you need to mouse over the unit for it to work.  The icon will stay active for several seconds, so just sweep your cursor over the mobs.  (Yes, sweeping your cursor over mobs DOES incur some performance hits, since it signals the Tidy Plates core, though nothing that hurts my framerate.  I'm pretty confident that just about ALL of you downloading this have a much faster machine than I do.)

Beta 5
Grey -Fixes for tank and dps saved variables
Grey- Panel improvements
Grey- Function improvements
Scale function changes

Beta 5&6
Bug Fixes n such

Beta 7
Changes to alpha handling, and adding the combo point widget back to the fray.  Added a few more Text modes.  Moved a bunch of things to the 5.10.X/5.11 list.

Beta 8
Changed some performance thingies, fixed some panel items, and retracted the Raid-Tanked widget (for now)

I'm going to move forward toward releasing 5.10.  In order to speed up the process, I had to move some features to future releases.



Threat Widget:
The Threat Widget is simply a statusbar, drawn from the center-line of the nameplates, which represents your relative threat to that unit.  When the bar extends right and becomes amber, you've got the attention of the unit; The length of that bar indicates your lead over the next highest threat-holder.  If the bar extendeds left, the color will change to cyan, indicating that the unit isn't attacking you.  The length of the bar will indicate how far your threat trails behind the top threat-holder.  Additionally, if you are NOT the highest threat-holder, the threat widget will tell you who is.

Summary; Tanks will want to see a right-pointing amber bar, while DPS will want to see left-leaning cyan.  Longer bars are safer.
