DoubleWide - Rearrange quest window to be side-by-side rather than stacked
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Request + Graphics: Kudane <kudane@wowinterface.com>
Development: Iriel <iriel@vigilance-committee.org>

NOTE: There are some AddOns which anchor things to the QuestWatchFrame
      (tourguide is one), that can interact with this and generate spurious
      action blocked messages in the taint log (because that makes the
      QuestWatchFrame secure so it cant hide itself in combat)
